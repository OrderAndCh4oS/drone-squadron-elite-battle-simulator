Tournaments can be paired by single elimination, double elimination, round-robin, double round-robin, Swiss, and Dutch. If round-robin, double round-robin, Swiss, or Dutch are chosen, then a single elimination or double elimination playoffs can follow. For Swiss, Dutch, and round-robin tournaments, the following tiebreakers systems are supported: Buchholz Cut 1 Solkoff (Buchholz) Median-Buchholz Sonneborn-Berger (Neustadtl) Cumulative (and Cumulative Opponent's) Versus Magic TCG Opponent's match win percentage Game win percentage Opponent's game win percentage Pokemon TCG Opponent's match win percentage Opponent's opponent's match win percentage A Couple Details For double elimination, the method in which players move to the loser's bracket follows the same four alternating orders as explained here. For round-robin (and double round-robin), players are paired via Berger Tables. For Swiss and Dutch, the pairing algorithms are created to be fast and efficient, but not perfect. Both formats guarantee that players can not play each other multiple times. The Dutch algorithm ensures players can not have a color preference of +/- 3 or play as the same color 3 times in a row (under the assumption that Dutch tournaments are chess tournaments). Installation npm install tournament-organizer Basic Usage const TournamentOrganizer = require('tournament-organizer'); // Create an event manager const manager = new TournamentOrganizer.EventManager(); // Create a tournament // First parameter can be set to a custom ID // More options are available to set const tourney = manager.createTournament(null, { name: 'My Example Tournament', format: 'swiss', playoffs: 'elim', cutLimit: 8, bestOf: 3, winValue: 3, drawValue: 1, tiebreakers: ['magic-tcg'] }); // Add players tourney.addPlayer('Liam S'); tourney.addPlayer('Emma P.'); tourney.addPlayer('Noah B.'); tourney.addPlayer('Sophia R.'); // As many as desired // Start the tournament tourney.startEvent(); // Get all active matches const active = tourney.activeMatches(); // Record a result tourney.result(active[0], 2, 1); // Get standings const standings = tourney.standings(); Implementations Bracketeer - A Discord bot that runs tournaments Contributing Please submit an issue if you encounter a bug or have a feature suggestion.
